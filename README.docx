Installing Scrapy
I am using my Ubuntu 16 System and Python 2.7
After that I am installing few dependencies for Scrapy parse documents

1	$ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
2	$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
3	$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

In order to scrap data in actual binary files We need the Pillow libraries.

1	$ pip install pillow
2	$ pip install scrapy

1	$ scrapy startproject timecoverspider
